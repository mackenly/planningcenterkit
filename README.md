# Planning Center Kit
ORM for Planning Center Online's APIs

> [!WARNING]  
> This project is very much a work in progress and is not yet ready for production use (unless you're feeling adventurous!). Please check back later for updates.

While [Planning Center Online](https://www.planningcenter.com/developers) (PCO) offers a robust set of APIs, working with them can be cumbersome and time-consuming. This library aims to simplify the process of working with PCO's APIs by providing a flexible ORM that allows you to interact with the APIs in a more intuitive way using typed objects and methods. 

If you don't use TypeScript, don't worry! This library is written in TypeScript but works just as well in plain JavaScript.
